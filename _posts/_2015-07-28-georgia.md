I have been looking for an answer to a problem of **typesetting on the web**: how should my web content be styled when every user agent different fonts? Disdaining the work of provisioning for different contingencies and unaccepting of the download burden of web fonts, I resolved to consider only fonts that are virtually everywhere; the so-called 'web safe' fonts.

Of the serif typefaces (which I prefer for body text), I found two with wide enough an install base, <i>Times New Roman</i> and <i>Georgia</i>. I found the latter a bit more pleasant aesthetically, preferring its larger x-height and diminished contrast between thick and thin strokes; and the matter was decided when I discovered that with Times, italicized text was rendered with a deficient x-height compared with neighbouring roman characters, particularly at a small font size.
