# Book: _Microinteractions_

### About the book
<p delete-line/>
- _Microinteractions_ (2013)
- By Dan Saffer

My curiosity can be represented roughly by two questions: What is a 'microinteraction?,' and why is it important? I feel I must account for why I chose to glance at this book: it was included on Don Norman's [reading list](http://www.jnd.org/recommended_readings.html). I am finding its material to be *painfully* obvious. --- In answer to my questions, a 'microinteraction' is an interaction, the _micro_ being superfluous; and as far as why they're important, the argument looks something like this: having a wife relies not so much on the marriage contract as it does on the very details of how you hold and love her.

[I couldn't bear to continue reading this past the first chapter.]
