'Traditional' heuristics (i.e. Based on Nielsen (2004)):

- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from, errors
- Help and documentation

Additional heuristics:
