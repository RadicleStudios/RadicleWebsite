The site we're most proud of is
[elizabethschindler.com](http://elizabethschindler.com).

## Do us a favour

Visit the above site and tell me everything you don't like about it---Raphael,
[raphael@radicle.io](mailto:raphael@radicle.io).

## Simplicity

I strive to make the simplest websites possible. Our ideal client understands
the value of this.

## Elegance

We strive for a beauty that is not an affectation, but results from directly
meeting the website visitors' needs. Producing the desired effect with an
economy of effort; it's that elegance we're after.

## Ease

Not only the website itself, but the entire arc from first contact to project
completion, has a quality of _ease_. We mean to make our clients' lives *less*
complicated.

## How to begin

Simply reach out---Raphael, [raphael@radicle.io](mailto:raphael@radicle.io).
