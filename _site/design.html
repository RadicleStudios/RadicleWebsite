<h1>
  APP DESIGN
</h1>

<p>
  In our opinion, apps are almost universally poorly designed, and we find the impact to be unacceptable. A user experience of mediocre quality, as well as diminished revenues resulting from alienating technology-intimidated market segments &mdash; these implications simply don't excite us.
</p>

<p>
  We love exploring. We love to learn about how humans work, and to get right into the head of our users, so we can craft the best interfaces.
</p>

<p>
  We're not interested in doing it cheaper or faster than the other guy. We craft only the best interfaces, and that level of thinking doesn't come cheap.
</p>

<p>
  Further constraining ourselves, we only work on projects whose value we appreciate as being a contribution to society. And we only work with people we like, trust, and admire.
