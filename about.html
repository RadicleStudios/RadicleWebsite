<h1>About us and our mission</h1>

<ul without-top-margin>
  <li>We are a small technology company based in the community of Ambleside, West Vancouver, Canada.</li>
  <li>We think all the time about how to design technologies&mdash;chiefly apps for iPhone&mdash;that are user friendly.</li>
  <li>We publish <i>grey literature</i> [Wikipedia <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature'>link</a>]&mdash;white papers, evaluations, reports, <i>etc</i>&mdash;which we share openly, on the topic of how to design friendly interactions between humans and computers.</li>
  <li>We work with particular app producers to address specific needs&mdash;this is how we earn a living.</li>
  <li>(On occasion we'll develop an app for someone, or a website, but we claim to dislike this sort of work.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Most importantly: Whereas it is taken for granted that a business operates for the purpose of making money, we decidedly do <em>not</em> operate under that prerogative: we exist in order to contribute to humanity.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Our mission is to revolutionize how computers and humans interact</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Our first order of business is to improve an incredible opportunity, where even a tiny change can affect every one of us: the problem of software quality. I believe the experience of interacting with technology shouldn't be dreadful, but delightful.<sup>1</sup> I'm committing myself and Radicle to finding out what can be done to produce better apps, and sharing our findings to better the entire industry.
</p>
<p>
  Our second order of business is to grow powerful enough in order to bring everyone truly revolutionary technologies of human-computer interaction. For me, it's the <em>interface</em> that matters most. Just like when we interact with people: what we think about the people in our lives is so much wasted effort; it's the actual contact and conversations with them where we do the work and play of <em>connecting</em>.<sup>2</sup> And likewise with the experience of using apps: the quality of the interaction is an important part of how we feel about the technology.
</p>
<p>
  I believe us to be on the verge of being able to create truly revolutionary interactions with computers. I want that interface to become so diaphanous, so to speak, becoming so elegant, and so harmonic to what it is to be a human being, that it <em>disappears</em>; that all of us, in using technology, feel only the delight that comes from the consciousness of augmented human capability, or the delight of using only the finest tools to do our work.
</p>
<p>
  <em>That's</em> the delight we're working to bring you. First, by repairing the problem of software quality, and second, by taking interaction technology to the next step.
</p>
  
<!-- <p>
  I see a better way we can be designing iOS app interfaces, and I've created Radicle to deliver on that vision.
</p>
<p>
  What we provide here on this site are informational tidbits useful to those whose work involves iOS app interaction design. Think of us as an iOS interaction design think tank; and our first principle is to contribute to the industry.

    <li>
      If you don't think the apps we're making are dreadful, it may be because you're quite young. Ask your parents, or your grandparents, what <em>they</em> think of the technologies we're creating.
    </li>
    <li>
      As I write this, I reflect on my own lack of engagement with those dear to me, and I know I should take my own advice and be in better communication with them.
