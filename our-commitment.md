# Our commitment

In my view---and this is Raphael writing---, the way we're currently designing apps makes for dreadful user experiences, particularly for older adults. Why does using the iPhone provoke my mom to anxiety? Apps aren't tools anymore, merely: we cannot take them or leave them: they are ever more an integral part of society and culture. From that viewpoint, it is unethical to be designing apps so only a few can use them well.

I wonder if we, the software industry, can design our apps to a much higher standard of usability; and I wonder if it could even cost less to do so, all considered. I created Radicle to answer these questions.

We're committed to making massive contributions in the domain of human-computer interaction. We're out to transform the industry! Let's see if we can.
