# Understanding fundamental user-interface components: tables

## Preamble

### Why
<p dl/>
We want to understand what makes for a good user interface, so let's understand the building blocks out of which user interfaces are assembled. Tables are one of the most basic components that are yet complex enough to be interesting to talk about. So let's start there.

## What is a table?

The answer may seem obvious, but I assure you, it is not. Let's work through this. Wikipedia says a table is "an arrangement of data in rows and columns," but I find this definition not to be very illuminating. I think a table to be a visual depiction of a (mathematical) set: a table is a list of things. People look at tables to *read* them.

Something else that people read is text, so let's consider how a table is different. The simplest table I can think of is numbers. I mean the way we write them, which Fibonacci conveyed from the Arabic to the Western world. When we read $28,657, for instance, we are reading a table. Look:

<table>
  <th>$</th>
  <tr><td>Number of tens of thousands &nbsp;</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Number of thousands</td><td>8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Number of hundreds</td><td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Number of tens</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Number of ones</td><td>7</td></tr>
</table>

Another way $28,657 could have been written, which is *not* in table form, is $<span with-overline>XXVIII</span>DCLVII, and even though we aren't that well acquainted with Roman numerals, we can yet feel this way of writing numbers to be less workable. And so I am confident we found the purpose of tables: to make text more workable: more *usable*.

A table is a technology to make certain kinds of text more usable.

## How do we recognize a table?

A table's form or _morphology_ comprises two vital regions that speak about different things: the heading speaks *about the table*, and the rows collectively speak what is meant to be communicated. We recognize a table by noticing these two regions, as well as the corrugated regularity of the rows in the content.

## What does a table look like on an iPhone?

We can clearly discern the conventions that speak 'table:' there is a hard-rule-embelished regularity that speaks 'rows,' and the visually separated upper region speaks, 'header.' 

## How do tables differ on an iPhone vs paper?

The main difference is in the 'logistics' of viewing it all. If a number of sheets may be needed to show a large table, on an iPhone, the same challenge is addressed by _scrolling_ (_ie_ touching and moving the 'screenful' of content).

## Paper may be superior

It's important to realize that when it comes to viewing tables, the iPhone affords a compromised experience compared with paper. I'd argue the iPad to be on par, because of its larger form factor. A table that can be printed on a standard sheet would be too large for an iPhone screen, so you will have to scroll; and as soon as the entire table be not available at a single glance, it's far less efficient to read it. (Human-computer interaction researchers call this )

## Does it matter if paper be superior?

We are a little bad at  'good,' 'bad,' and 'better;' and sometimes we
