> Increasingly complex software, installed on increasingly complex mobile devices, being used in increasing complex environments is presenting Mobile HCI with serious challenges. This paper presents a brief overview of five experiments before presenting a final experiment in detail. These experiments attempt to understand the relationship between cognition, distraction, usability and performance.

> Mobile devices are challenging HCI in many new and unexpected ways. Many of these challenges can be seen to stem from two main aspects:
> 
> Firstly, mobile devices are becoming powerful and this is allowing increasingly complex software to be used on them. Secondly, mobile devices are being used in far more complex environments.

> Usability is defined by the ISO as “the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments.” (ISO 9241-11, 1998). A usable system should be easy to use (utility) and easy to learn (learnability) (Nielsen, 1994).

> Previous research (Deegan and Rothwell, 2010) suggested that there were many unconsidered extraneous distractions that a mobile user would face and presented a model of these distractions. They suggested that distractions can occur from 1) the content itself 2) the application 3) the system software 4) the device hardware and 5) the greater environment.
