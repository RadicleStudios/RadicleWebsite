# About us

- We are a small technology company based in the community of Ambleside, West Vancouver, Canada.
- We think all the time about how to design technologies to be more usable.
- We gather the thinking from the best minds.
- We write, hoping that what we write will influence the industry.
- We get retained to audit particular apps---this is how we earn a living.
- (On occasion we'll develop an app for someone, or a website, but we claim to dislike this sort of work.)

Most importantly: Whereas it is taken for granted that a business operates for the purpose of making money, we decidedly do <em>not</em> operate under that prerogative: we exist in order to contribute.
