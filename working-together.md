# Working together

Some of our views, principles, and orientations will surprise you:
<p dl/>
- We operate on a high level of integrity.
- We're way more excited about contributing than making money.
- We don't believe in the ownership of ideas: hence, many companies that have a secretive style of operating won't want to work with us, because we like to talk about what we're working on.
- Knowledge and expertise are not nearly as useful as ignorance and curiosity, not even in the same ball park
